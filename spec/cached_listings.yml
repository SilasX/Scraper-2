  :title: Principal Engineer - Ruby or Python (SOMA / south beach)
  :description: ! 'This is a full-time on-site position in SOMA only.  Sorry but no
    contractors or remote employees can be considered.<br>

    <br>

    We code in Ruby, but are open to engineers with strong backgrounds in any interpreted
    or functional languages (Python*, Lisp, Scala, Erlang . . .).  Even a Java background
    might be OK, if you can show us that you are still learning and growing as an
    engineer. No C# /.Net engineers though: there are limits! You should be rock-solid
    competent with the programming languages and tools that you currently work with,
    be *really* comfortable with Linux/Unix (we are a DevOps shop). You should also
    be fun to work with.<br>

    <br>

    We don''t hire rock stars or ninjas or pirates . . . just great software engineers
    who like working closely together to build awesome products. Everyone on our team
    is top-notch, and it''s a very collaborative work environment. so you''ll learn
    a lot by working here.<br>

    <br>

    Company is growing fast (60 million visitors/month), which leads to fun scaling
    and performance challenges. We dominate our category.<br>

    <br>

    Our current architectural challenges include refactoring and upgrading a large
    Ruby on Rails codebase to Rails 3.2, orienting our architecture around a message
    bus (RabbitMQ), and promoting loose coupling by moving to an REST API-centric
    architecture. Oh some big-data stuff too (MongoDB is pretty big part of our setup,
    and we''re mapping out some features that would require Hadoop, but no promises
    on that one). <br>

    <br>

    You should have many years* of experience in industry, and previous experience
    dealing with very large code bases and very high-volume web applications. This
    is a hands-on position: you will code every day, and when you''re not coding you''ll
    be helping other people structure their code, reviewing other peoples'' code,
    or reading code. <br>

    <br>

    How we roll:<br>

    Unit and integration tests run automagically on every commit - so we can tell
    if we break stuff<br>

    Dozens of code deployments per day . . . means you can ship code WHENEVER your
    feature is ready.<br>

    Code-reviews within the team performed using Google code review on all checkins.<br>

    We dedicate time every month to paying down existing technical debt.<br>

    Systems are all automated using puppet. <br>

    We make heavy use of cloud computing<br>

    Offices in SOMA, 2 blocks from BART, Muni, and CalTrain<br>

    Competitive salary, stock options, health, vision and dental insurance<br>

    We play foosball with passion! (at least once a day)<br>

    <br>

    * Especially Python. For some weird reason many of us are former Python devs.
    The Python-&gt;Ruby learning curve is easy, and we can help.<br>

    <br>

    ** No we''re not going to say how many. It depends on what you were doing. Point
    is, this ain''t a position for greenhorns.  <br>
