<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.zocdoc.com/images/Logo_nobeta_sm.gif"><br>
<p><strong>What we're looking for</strong><br>
ZocDoc is seeking software engineers who want to use serious CS skills to build technology that really helps people. You enjoy a good conversation about theory or architecture, but you are happiest writing code and turning those ideas into usable products. You care about the quality of your code and products more than anyone you know. You think about the experience of using your products as you're building them.<br>
<br>
<strong>Working at ZocDoc</strong><br>
We were recently named the Best Place to Work in New York City by Crain's New York, which means that they asked everyone who works here how much they loved their job and everyone answered in the range of "a lot" to "a helluva lot." The truth is, we have a lot of fun doing our job. We get excited about <a target="_blank" href="http://codedoc.zocdoc.com/" rel="nofollow">sharing some new C# language feature or optimization strategy</a>. We go on semi-annual hackathons to remote, exotic places (like the Catskills and Long Island!). Pizza and beer are never far away. Neither are granola and tea, for that matter.<br>
<br>
<strong>Our Offices</strong><br>
We work in a massive loft-y space in the heart of SoHo. Devs get top-notch gear (12gb RAM, 3 monitor setups, etc) and interact a lot with the rest of the team. <br>
<br>
<strong>We want someone who</strong><br>
- Is experienced with an OOP language.<br>
- Has used a relational or non-relational or ur-relational database.<br>
- Is driven by an unknown force to change healthcare for the better.<br>
- Likes thinking about performance. All. The. Time.<br>
<br>
<strong>As a ZocDoc employee you getï¿½</strong><br>
- A feeling of accomplishing something genuinely useful to humanity.<br>
- Relocation fees fully covered.<br>
- A competitive salary.<br>
- Free catered lunches every day.<br>
- 100% employer-covered health insurance.<br>
- Stock options.<br>
- A hoverboard.*<br>
<br>
*subject to availability<br>
<br>
If this sounds like the gig for you, send us your resume and in your cover letter tell us what we should change to make our website, zocdoc.com, even better.<br>

<description><![CDATA[Software Engineer in Test, Cloud Services<br>
<br>
Quality engineering at Sencha is about design, development and the implementation of complex automation functionality. The role is a engineering position, focused on delivering quality. You have to be comfortable with only initial manual testing of new features, primarily so you have the understanding to correctly architect and implement the automation you want to build. You have a strong background in object-oriented programming concepts and constructs (JavaScript, Ruby, Java, et al). You will need to identify missing test cases and refine existing code for modularity and automation purposes, estimate and prioritize work for optimal risk mitigation and identify suitable regression suites.<br>
<br>
You must actually like to break things, be exhilarated when you discover that really complicated defect and provide enough details that the team can act on them and then help to develop the resolution. You  have to be self directed, team oriented, and actually know and care about what our users are trying to accomplish by using our products.<br>
<br>
Responsibilitlies:<br>
<br>
This role isn't quality assurance in the traditional black-box testing sense, think development operations. You will focus on the goal of helping us build a great experience for our cloud services, from the customer facing API to the backend data store.<br>
