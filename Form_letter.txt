Hi.  I saw your post on craigslist when I was browsing.  I really like this unit, and I'd let to set up a walk-through.  I particularly like the part about "#random_string_from_post", that's pretty nice!

Just so we're on the same page, I'm talking about this post: #Link

Reply back if you'd consider renting to me.

Hoping to hear back,
